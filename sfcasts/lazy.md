# Lazy Services

Time to talk about one of my *favorite* Symfony features: lazy services. Many
times, you inject a service, but it's only used under certain conditions. Here's
an example:

```php
public function calculateSomething(ExpensiveService $service)
{
    if ($this->isCached()) {
        return $this->getCachedValue();
    }

    return $service->doSomethingExpensive();
}
```

In this case, *most* of the time, the `ExpensiveService` is not used. But, because
it's injected, it's always instantiated.

A "lazy service" gets to relax on the couch, eating potato chips, until it's actually needed.

## Create a New Button

Let's do one! Create a new PHP class in `src/Remote/` called
`ParentalControls`. This will send us alerts when the kids
are doing something they totally *know* they shouldn't.
The little rascals. Mark the class as `final` and add a constructor
with: `private MailerInterface $mailer` so we can send the alerts via
email:

[[[ code('d4f9d598d9') ]]]

Add a new public method called `volumeTooHigh()` with a `void` return type. Inside,
to represent sending the email, just write `dump('send volume alert email')`:

[[[ code('69225f1594') ]]]

Next, open up `VolumeUpButton`, add a constructor *here* and inject
`private ParentalControls $parentalControls`:

[[[ code('4ec52d9ac3') ]]]

In the `press()` method, pretend we're detecting when the volume is too high.
Add an `if (true)` statement (with a comment to remind us what this represents),
then `$this->parentalControls->volumeTooHigh()`:

[[[ code('3ef8ad588b') ]]]

Spin over to our app, refresh, press the "volume up" button, and check the profiler.
We can see our `ParentalControls` service *is* being used and working!

Back in `VolumeUpButton`, switch `true` to `false` to pretend we didn't detect
a high volume. Below the if statement, write `dump($this->parentalControls)`:

[[[ code('a87cfe375e') ]]]

Spin back, refresh, press "volume up" and check the profiler. Even though we didn't
use `ParentalControls`, it was still instantiated! So was the mailer service it depends
on, the mailer transport, and so on. This is a long chain of dependencies
that were instantiated but not used!

## `#[Lazy]` Class Attribute

The fix? Make `ParentalControls` a lazy service. Open that class and add the `#[Lazy]`
attribute:

[[[ code('2dd0260632') ]]]

Back in our app, refresh, and... an error!

> Cannot generate lazy proxy for service `ParentalControls`.

Check the previous exception to see why:

> Class `ParentalControls` is final.

This is a minor downside of using lazy services: the class cannot be final.
We'll see why in a second.

Open `ParentalControls`, remove final...

[[[ code('4ad8c9a44b') ]]]

and refresh the app. We're good!

Press "volume up" and check the profiler.

## Ghost Proxies

Whoa! What's this? `ParentalControlsGhost` with a random string after it?
This is called a "ghost proxy" and it's generated by Symfony. It extends our `ParentalControls`
class (which is why it can't be final) and, until it's actually used, is not fully
instantiated - a ghost! Spooky!

But what if we didn't "own" `ParentalControls`? What if it was part of a 3rd party package?
How could we make it lazy? We can't edit vendor code, but the `#[Lazy]` attribute can be
added to an argument to make it lazy on a per-use basis.

## `#[Lazy]` Argument Attribute

In `ParentalControls`, remove `#[Lazy]`:

[[[ code('4ad8c9a44b') ]]]

and in `VolumeUpButton`, add `#[Lazy]` above the `$parentalControls` argument:

[[[ code('37be2e208d') ]]]

In our app, refresh, press "volume up", and check the profiler. It's still lazy!

When you add the `#[Lazy]` attribute to a class, *all* instances of that service are lazy.
When you add it to an argument, it's lazy only when used in that context.

What if it existed in a 3rd party package *and* was final? Are we out of luck?

Nope! Symfony has a few other tricks - and attributes - up its sleeve to help.
Let's check those out next!
